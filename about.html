    <h2>Introduction:</h2>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BMI is a measurement of a person's leanness or corpulence based on their heigh
        t and weight, and is intended to quantify tissue mass. It is widely used as a general indicator of whether a person has a heal
        thy body weight for their height. Specifically, the value obtained from the calculation of BMI is used to categorize whether a
         person is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese depending on what range the value falls between. These ranges of BMI
         vary based on factors such as region and age, and are sometimes further divided into subcategories such as severely underweight or very severely obese. Being overweight or underweight can have significant health effects, so while BMI is an imperfect measure of healthy body weight, it is a useful indicator of whether any additional testing or action is required. Refer to the table below to see the different categories based on BMI that are used by the calculator.</p>

         <h3>BMI table for adults:</h3>
           <p>&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This is the World Health Organization's (WHO) recommended body weight based on BMI values for adults. It is used for both men and women, age 20 or older.</p>

<h3>BMI FORMULA:</h3>
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Below are the equations used for calculating BMI in the International System of Units (SI) and the US customary system (USC) using a 5'10", 160-pound individual as an example:</P>

<h3>Limitation of BMI:</h3>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Although BMI is a widely used and useful indicator of healthy body weight, it does have its limitations. BMI is only an estimate that cannot take body composition into account. Due to a wide variety of body types as well as distribution of muscle, bone mass, and fat, BMI should be considered along with other measurements rather than being used as the sole method for determining a person's healthy body weight.</p>
<br>
<h3>in adults:</h3>
<p>BMI cannot be fully accurate because it is a measure of excess body weight, rather than excess body fat. BMI is further influenced by factors such as age, sex, ethnicity, muscle mass, body fat, and activity level, among others. For example, an older person who is considered a healthy weight, but is completely inactive in their daily life may have significant amounts of excess body fat even though they are not heavy. This would be considered unhealthy, while a younger person with higher muscle composition of the same BMI would be considered healthy. In athletes, particularly bodybuilders who would be considered overweight due to muscle being heavier than fat, it is entirely possible that they are actually at a healthy weight for their body composition. Generally, according to the CDC:</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>1)&nbsp;Older adults tend to have more body fat than younger adults with the same BMI.</li>
<li>2)&nbsp;Women tend to have more body fat than men for an equivalent BMI.</li>
<li>3)&nbsp;Muscular individuals and highly trained athletes may have higher BMIs due to large <br>muscle mass.</li>

</ul>
